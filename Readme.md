The website layout is rudimentary but designed to fulfill requirements as I go along.

I also do not have that many deployed applications as I am relatively new to the coding scene, so some of these links link to static pngs or my company website.

You can navigate the website by clicking on the items in the header, and hovering and clicking the logos in the "My work and hobbies" section will bring you to a separate website.
