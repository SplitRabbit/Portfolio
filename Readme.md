This is a portfolio for Jeffrey Wang aka SplitRabbit

The website layout is rudimentary but designed to fulfill requirements as I go along.

I also do not have that many deployed applications as I am relatively new to the coding scene, so some of these links link to static pngs or my company website.

The navigation bar will allow you to go to each section, and hovering and clicking the logos will allow you to go to each website.
